with gauging the distance. The selection of words and their use change depending on the mental and relational distance between you and your counterpart. In Korean for instance, differentiating between when and to whom to speak casually or in honorific terms is crucial. It\u2019s standard practice to speak in honorifics when meeting someone for the first time to minimize any chances of miscommunication by subtly creating a suitable amount of distance between you and the person you are meeting. The common courtesy of \u201cnot crossing the line\u201d is associated with gauging this distance.</p>\n        <p>With this in mind, it isn\u2019t difficult to gauge the distance between people featured in a transcript of a conversation. Things like what sort of relationship they are in and when and how long ago the dialog took place can be surmised from the terminology and vocabulary used, and the theme of the conversation. Certain jargons and phrases can be hints to the time period. Some forms language can only be used within certain groups of people, or among those who have collectively made an agreement to use said forms of language. Titles that can only be used among people in certain relationships (distances) and words that might be misunderstood without understanding their proper context warrant even more thorough measurements.</p>\n        <p>Gauging the distance is also important when designing typefaces, posters, and websites. Defining the distance between each element, the relationships among the different parts is one of the key tasks of a designer. And repeating this activity inevitably caused tech neck. I squint, I gaze from afar, I repeatedly zoom in and out. But I can\u2019t seem to abandon my habit of getting up close and personal with the monitor.</p>\n        <p>Many would agree that some things can only be seen up close and others at an arm\u2019s length, but most of the time, many hope that someone would study them more closely, to deepen the relationship and get to know more about them. What if zooming in through the monitor is to get more intimate, not just increasing the size? And what if you could see things you couldn\u2019t before, you were able to understand what they are saying a little bit better? Would that change what \u201csuitable\u201d is in a \u201csuitable amount of distance\u201d?</p>",z="<p>\u2018\ubcf4\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4\ub3c4 \ubcf4\uace0 \uc2f6\uc740~ \ubcf4\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4\ub3c4

Korean drama entitled \u2039First Love\u203a that aired on KBS in 1996, Joo Jeong-nam (portrayed by Son Hyun-joo) writes a song for his love interest Seong Chan-ok (portrayed by Song Chae-hwan) to express how much he loves her. This serenade that is composed of a wistful, yet bright melody accompanied by poignant lyrics became quite popular outside of the show.</p>\n      <p>After the declaration of the pandemic in 2020, video phone calls and conference calls have become a part of our everyday lives. Now, 25 years after the show was on, the song \u201cMissing You Even When I See You\u201d is not only a romantic song sung by a lovelorn character but has become one of the most accurate reflections of the reality we face today.</p>\n      <p>Video phone calls that have now become ubiquitous was the go-to future technology that was depicted in science fiction novels and movies. In fact, this technology was already a part of our lives even before the spread of COVID-19 and was sometimes used by a number of people. We considered it an advanced technology, as we called to mind what we imagined and watched in the movies even when it became commercialized. Although the video call was an available option to us, most of the work was done over email or in-person until right before the spread of the novel disease. But now we have had to accept it as a regular part of our communication, and in doing so we lost our ability to amuse ourselves with the delightfully si-fi technology and instead we\u2019re scurrying to adapt to the future that is suddenly upon us. This technology that we believed was the key to effective communication no matter where we are ironically became a device that showed us how far apart we are, and that we aren\u2019t able to be together.</p>\n      <p>They say speech and writing has to reflect the person\u2019s sincerity; there is no such thing as an empty heartfelt greeting. Handwritten text may look a bit crooked, but it feels more sincere than typed text. It might be more difficult to pick up on how much heart went into a sentence when it is pristinely printed or displayed on a screen compared to something that is written, erased and rewritten over and over again. Even so, what if, say, 30 years later with technology that much more advanced, wouldn\u2019t it be easier to bear our soul through our writing? We can already take a photo of our handwritten message and post it to show how we feel.</p>\n      <p>Consider this: we are all working hard to capture our souls in writing today, although it\u2019s gotten a little bit colder than someone\u2019s \u201cgood-ole days\u201d; and jinjeongseong (\uc9c4\uc815\uc131), the Korean word for sincerity began to enjoy its heyday only very recently, after the start of the 21st century. Perhaps the days of creating writing that can really embody our deepest feelings isn\u2019t so far away.
